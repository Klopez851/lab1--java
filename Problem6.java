// Description: reflection on java vs python



// Python and Java are very different programming languages. Python is much simpler and abstract; when you make a
// variable Python knows what type it is, a function doesn't need specification as to what type of information it will
// return, and list are very easy to use and create. Java is much more complicated compared to Python. You need to
// specify the type of information a variable will hold, what type of information a method will return, everything is
// an object or a class...etc. Java is much less abstract and hands-on then Python making it more challenging to learn.
// This makes learning Java, in my opinion, more fun.
